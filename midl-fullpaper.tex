\begin{abstract}
Automatic detection of critical findings on chest CT scans, such as lung nodules, is important to help radiologists in their clinical workflow, such as identifying time-sensitive cases and detecting incidental findings. Although deep learning (DL) models have become a promising predictive technology with near-human accuracy, they commonly suffer from lack of explainability, which is an important aspect for clinical deployment of DL models in the highly regulated healthcare industry. For example, localizing critical findings in an image is useful for explaining the predictions of DL classification algorithms. Although there have been a host of joint classification and localization methods for computer vision, state-of-the-art DL models require locally annotated training data in the form of pixel-level labels or bounding-box coordinates. In the medical domain, this requires an expensive amount of manual annotation by medical experts for each critical finding. This requirement becomes a major barrier for training models that can rapidly scale to various findings. In this article, we propose an interpretable DL algorithm based on multiple instance learning that jointly classifies and localizes critical findings in chest CT without the need for local annotations.

Image segmentation is a challenging and important topic in medical imaging with tremendous potential impact in clinical practice. State-of-the-art methods rely on hand-crafted annotations which hinder clinical translation since histology suffers from significant variations between cancer phenotypes. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised framework for chest CT segmentation that relies on standard clinical annotations, available in most medical systems. In particular, we exploit a multiple instance learning scheme for training models. The proposed framework has been evaluated on multi-locations and multi-centric public data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and the PatchCamelyon dataset. Promising results compared with experts' annotations demonstrate the potential of the presented approach.

\section{Introduction}

Here is where the content of your paper goes.  Some random
notes\footnote{Random footnote are discouraged}:
\begin{itemize}
\item You should use \LaTeX \cite{Lamport:Book:1989}.
\item JMLR/PMLR uses natbib for references. For simplicity, here, \verb|\cite|  defaults to
  parenthetical citations, i.e. \verb|\citep|. You can of course also use \verb|\citet| for textual citations.
\item Eprints such as arXiv papers can of course be cited \cite{Hinton:arXiv:2015:Distilling}. We recomend using a \verb|@misc| bibtex entry for these as shown in the sample bibliography.
\item You should follow the guidelines provided by the conference.
\item Read through the JMLR template documentation for specific \LaTeX
  usage questions.
\item Note that the JMLR template provides many handy functionalities
such as \verb|\figureref| to refer to a figure,
e.g. \figureref{fig:example},  \verb|\tableref| to refer to a table,
e.g. \tableref{tab:example} and \verb|\equationref| to refer to an equation,
e.g. \equationref{eq:example}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Proof of Theorem 1}

This is a boring technical proof of
\begin{equation}\label{eq:example}
\cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta \equiv 1.
\end{equation}

\section{Proof of Theorem 2}

This is a complete version of a proof sketched in the main text.
